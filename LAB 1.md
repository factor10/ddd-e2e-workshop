## Goals

- Get to know the commands used in this repository
- Get to know the Cypress Test Runner GUI

## Steps

1. Complete all the steps in README.md

2. In the Cypress Test Runner GUI, then run individual test files by clicking their name.

3. In the Cypress Test Runner GUI, try to run all tests by clicking the link `Run 4 integration specs`.

4. Open the repository in an editor, I use VS Code.

5. Locate the e2e tests in `test/e2e`. They are named according to the pattern `**.spec.js`

6. Open any test file and edit it to make it fail. Notice that the tests are automatically re-run.

7. Edit the test back to pass and make sure you have a suite of passing tests.
