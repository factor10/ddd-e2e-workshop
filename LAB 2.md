# Lab 2: Test after

## Goals

- Write a new Cypress test
- Get to know how the fixtures work

## Task

Write a new test given the following scenario:

> _Given_ that consultant Stina has registered 60 min Programming on the New app on 2021-02-02
>
> _When_ registering 30 min Meeting about the New app
>
> _Then_ Sina has a total registered time of 90 min

You can probably take a lot of inspiration from an existing test which adds time to an day which has no privious registrations :)

Make sure that you setup the scenario correct.
